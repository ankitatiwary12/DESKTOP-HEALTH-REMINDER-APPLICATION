# DESKTOP-HEALTH-REMINDER-APPLICATION
• Inspired by health reminder watches and mobile apps, we developed a desktop HEALTH APP.
• Crafted using a strategic blend of prominent Python libraries, the application generates timely 
notifications every 30-60 minutes, promoting hydration and movement for better health.
• Constructed on Python 3.10, employing essential libraries such as time, notification handling, and 
ICO app icons for a cohesive technical foundation.
